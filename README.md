# bamazonNew
This is a Node.js store inventory app that runs in your terminal.

To run this app on your device, clone all files to your computer, then npm install mysql and npm install inquirer.

Navigate to the root in your terminal and run by inputting node bamazonCustomer.js

You will then see a table appear in your terminal with the items available and their stock quantities.  

Once prompted, type in the item you would like to purchase (ex. shoes).

Next, you will type in a number of the items you would like to purchase and if successful, you will see "Product Purchased!"

When the table pulls up again, then the stock_quantity column will be reduced by the number of items you purchased.

See demo below :)
